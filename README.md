# Repo to learn how to develop using React

## Repo structure

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A simple tic-tac-toe game to understand how react works.
- **Clone of Candy Crush**: The game is available at [https://giacob500.github.io/learning-react/](https://giacob500.github.io/learning-react/).

## Reason for implementation
### Tic-Tac-Toe
I followed the React official documentation which includes a simple introductory tutorial on how to build a tic-tac-toe game.
### Clone of Candy Crush
I created this simplified verison of the famous Candy Crush game because my girfriend wanted to play that game without all the menus and additions around the core of the gameplay.
